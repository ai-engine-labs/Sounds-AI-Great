# 🎙️ Sounds-AI-Great

A real-time audio pipeline for streaming **speech-to-text** (STT) transcription and audio intelligence. Built on top of an internal AI engine, this product delivers **low-latency, multilingual audio analysis** through a clean CLI interface.

---

## ✨ What Is This?

**Sounds-AI-Great** is a product designed to process audio streams and return transcriptions, optionally including metadata such as speaker segmentation or timestamps. It supports both **streaming** and **batch** modes and is designed to integrate with mobile apps, SaaS tools, or standalone interfaces.

This repository is the CLI-based reference implementation of the system.

## 🧰 Core Features

* 🎙️ Multi-speaker diarization (configurable)
* ⚙️ Real-time or batch-mode transcription
* 🔌 Pluggable backend selection (abstracted)
* 📦 Structured output formats (`.json`, `.txt`, `.srt`)
* 🔁 Background queue support with retries
* 📊 Optional metrics, logging, and audit trails

> Product logic is powered by a shared internal backend — no direct access or configuration of the core AI engine is required from this repo.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

* Python 3.10+
* CLI-first architecture
* Optional WebSocket/API integration layer
* Docker-ready workflows
